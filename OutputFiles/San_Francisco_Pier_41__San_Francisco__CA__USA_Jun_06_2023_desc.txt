 I stood alone at the edge of Pier 41, staring out at the silent, empty boats bobbing up and down in the dark water below. The Filmy night air was cool on my skin as I closed my eyes and listened to the gentle lapping of the waves against the pier. I thought about all the adventures I had on those boats, all the people who had come into my life because of them. But now, in this lonely moment, I couldn't help but feel a sense of longing for something I couldn't quite put my finger on.}]
